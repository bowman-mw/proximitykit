# ``ProximityKit``

Fernlet's self-contained peer-to-peer subsystem: signed identity, MultipeerConnectivity + UWB session formation, trust lifecycle, and every in-person social feature (photos, recipes, the clothing shop, chat, hearts, activities, moderation).

## Overview

ProximityKit is the "meet in person" half of Fernlet's social layer. Nothing here talks to a
server except the heart dead-drop's injected transport seam; everything else moves over local
radios (MultipeerConnectivity for data, NearbyInteraction/UWB for distance) between two phones
that are physically together. The design center is a privacy stance the rest of the app depends
on: identities are per-device Ed25519/X25519 key pairs (``IdentityService``), every wire transfer
travels in a signed ``FernletIdentityEnvelope`` that is verified — signature, expiry, recipient,
replay, and mandatory sealing for sensitive payload types — before any handler sees it, and the
social exhaust (who you met, who sent you warmth, who you reported) lives in device-local sidecar
files that are deliberately **never** part of the synced snapshot.

**Position in the FernletKit graph and the S3 wall.** The `ProximityKit` target depends on
`PrivateMediaStore` (the sealed photo index behind the mesh photo cache), `FernletDomainModel`,
`FernletFoundation`, and `FernletUI` (for the two SwiftUI review sheets). It therefore sits on
the *protected* side of the S3 privacy wall: it may reach a sealed `Private*` store, and the
walled `AIProviders` / `CloudKitSync` targets can never import it (nor it them — the dead-drop's
CloudKit transport is injected app-side through the `HeartDropTransporting` seam, so this module
only ever hands ciphertext + rotating day tags outward). Its one seam back to app state is the
``ProximityHost`` protocol, which `FernletStore` conforms to via an app-side adapter; the
"outward edges only" rule keeps the module a black box the app drives, never the reverse. Note
the target-comment in `FernletKit/Package.swift` predates the `FernletUI` edge — the dependency
list in the manifest is the truth.

**How a session forms.** A radio owner (``MeshNetworkManager`` for the friend mesh,
``ProximityRecipeShareManager`` for recipe pairing, ``PresenceManager`` for presence hearts)
runs a `MeshMultipeerSession` — one shared MCSession multiplexed into per-peer
`PeerChannelTransport` channels. Each connected peer gets a ``ProximityCoordinator``, the
per-connection engine that exchanges signed identity introductions (carrying the UWB discovery
token, advertised capability tokens, and optionally a heart-drop prekey bundle), starts ranging
through a ``RangingProvider`` (``NIRangingSession`` in production), and gates the commit on
physical closeness: a 15 cm / 0.8 s UWB dwell measured by ``ProximityCommitDetector``, a manual
confirm on non-UWB hardware, or the QR verification ceremony (``ProximityVerifyQR``) which
upgrades a manual commit to ceremony grade. Trust questions along the way go to a
``ProximityTrustPolicy`` — ``FriendSessionTrustPolicy`` for friend radios (proximity *is* the
authorization; only blocked keys ban), ``CoachSessionTrustPolicy`` for the future coach channel
(only a remembered `.trainer` pairing auto-confirms), and ``ProximityTrustVault`` as the
persistent record store behind both, holding the friend/removed/blocked/reported lifecycle and
the audit trail.

**What rides a committed session.** ``MeshNetworkManager`` owns the feature payloads: disposable
camera photos (quota-capped, cached metadata-only through `PrivateMediaStore`, optionally
AES-GCM-encrypted under the rotating ``MeshGroupKey``), the in-person clothing shop
(``MeshClothingShop``, with its 1-hour post-session browse window), vanish-at-session-end chat
(``SessionMessageStore`` — deliberately not Codable so a message can never enter a snapshot),
in-session hearts, the one-hop moderation relay (``ModerationReportRelay`` →
``ModerationLedger`` → ``ModerationBanStore``), fuzzy friend state (``FriendStateCache``), and
Group Activities (``ProximityActivityManager``, whose authorization is a host-signed,
invitee-key-bound token rather than the shared handshake). Feature payloads dispatch through a
registry whose committed-slot gate is the security boundary; the session end promotes the roster
into the keep-as-friend review (``FriendMintingReview``, ``KeepFriendsPromptSheet``,
``FriendPhotoReviewSheet``).

**Presence and hearts.** ``PresenceManager`` runs a standing radio that broadcasts only rotating
pairwise-DH tags — no names, no stable identifiers, a fresh random MCPeerID per start — so kept
friends recognize each other nearby without connecting. Hearts are delivered over short-lived
connections formed on that recognition, with the sealed-introduction rule
(``SealedIntroductionEnvelope``) ensuring a tag-replay forger never sees an identity. When the
friend is away, ``HeartDropService`` seals the heart (``HeartDropSealer``, forward-secret via
``HeartPrekeyStore`` one-time/signed prekeys cached per friend in ``HeartDropPeerBundleCache``)
and queues it in the ``HeartDropOutbox`` for the injected dead-drop transport; the receive side
dedups durably (``HeartDropDedupStore``) and records into the shared ``ProximityHeartLedger``,
which enforces the bidirectional 5-minute rate limit for every heart transport.
``ClosenessLedger`` turns these interactions into the private closeness score.

**Concurrency and persistence invariants.** The target sets `defaultIsolation(MainActor.self)`
in Swift 6 language mode: managers, coordinators, and stores are `@MainActor` (most
`@Observable`), while every wire value type, the canonical signing serializer, and the pure
crypto statics are explicitly `nonisolated` + `Sendable` so untrusted bytes can be decoded and
signatures verified off the main actor (the WI-9 convention). Framework delegate callbacks
(MCSession, NearbyInteraction, ActivityKit) transfer non-Sendable objects across the main-actor
hop via documented `nonisolated(unsafe)` locals. Signing inputs come from the deterministic
binary serializer in `CanonicalSignatureSerializer.swift` (domain-tagged per signed type,
cross-platform stable; the legacy JSON encoder is retained verify-only). Persistence follows one
stance throughout: small JSON sidecars in Application Support with `.completeFileProtection`,
never synced — and the heart-sharing sidecars additionally load through ``ProtectedSidecar``
(sealed at rest via ``HeartDropSidecarSeal``), which classifies read failures so a locked-device
read can never be mistaken for "empty" and overwrite real data. Key material lives in the
keychain, ThisDeviceOnly, except the deliberately-synced backup-escrow key whose
content-addressed slot lifecycle ``IdentityService`` reconciles non-silently.

Before changing anything here, read the wire-compatibility notes on the type you are touching:
canonical signing bytes, sealed-payload framing (``SealedPayloadFraming``), the freeze/park
handling of unknown payload types, and the additive-optional-key rule for intro payloads are all
compatibility contracts with in-field peers.
